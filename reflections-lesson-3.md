# When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

### You might want to use a remote repository for the following reasons:

*Github provides free storage when you host a public repository. This allows for a built-in back-up that you do not maintain.
*If there are multiple collaborators working on the same project, a remote repository can act as the home base of the most recent version that people can collaborate on.
*If you use multiple machines, you won't need to worry about getting access to another machine's storage.
